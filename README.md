# HR-Management-System

This project is based on NestJS and Maybe you can find it simple because it is my first nestjs project.
Few things to be highlighted:
MongoDB Atlas has been used for store data.
this project is consist of three parts [ candidate, job, job-application ]
And CRUD operations of all three has been included.
I use refrences of schemas to populate things together.
