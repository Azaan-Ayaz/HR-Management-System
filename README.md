In last two days I have worked in NestJS to create CRUD operations for candidate, job, job application.
At the starting I tried for postgreSQL but i can't work properly. So then I go for alternate MongoDB.\
and I create schemas and then pass them into DTO and as well as in service for create the CRUD operation 
and to manage the routes then I call the services inside controller for CRUD operation functionality 
and as well as beside this one must be check module files for checking things work going smoothly.
